                <p>{{ _("My name is Serhii Kulbachenko, and I have been working in the construction industry for a long time. It all started when I came to Kyiv and received education in the specialties of bricklayer-stove-setter, electric welder, and installer of reinforced concrete structures. My journey began as a laborer in a construction team, but I realized my potential and decided to start my own business. Over time, I formed my own construction team, attracting many satisfied customers due to years of experience and professionalism. Working in Europe, I became acquainted with new materials, technologies, and standards. With a constant commitment to improvement, I successfully organized and developed my business from scratch, continuing to provide high-quality services and earn your trust. I'll be happy to collaborate!") }}</p>
