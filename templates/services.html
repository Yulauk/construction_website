								<h2>Our 4-Step Process</h2>
								<p>Be it a full home renovation, condo remodel, or kitchen redesign, our four-step process is straightforward and organized: an initial consultation with one of our team leads; project design led by one of our architects; construction by one of our in-house crews; and job close out with the whole team.</p>

										<h3>Consultation</h3>

								</div>
								<div class="our-process-right">
									<p>At Four Brothers we pride ourselves on delivering a high level of personal service. That starts on Day One with a visit to your home. We want to get acquainted with your living space—and you. What are your ideas and vision for the project? Do you have special needs? We’d like to see any photos or sketches you’ve clipped. We’ll talk about timeframe and budget and take some rough measurements. We’ll be on the look-out for any foreseeable issues, like electrical, structural, plumbing or zoning concerns. Our home visit takes between 30 and 60 minutes, depending upon the complexity of the project. We’ll follow up within seven days with a preliminary proposal that will include a ballpark cost estimate.</p>

										<h3>Design</h3>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="our-process-right">
									<p>Once our estimate is approved, we move to the design and preconstruction phase. Our project architects will work to match your design program with your construction budget. In this phase, we research and select materials and produce conceptual, permit and construction drawings. We also create three-dimensional renderings to help you visualize the new space. This critical phase of the project is generally more time-consuming than actual construction and requires close coordination with you, the client, for your input. We expedite the process by creating a detailed design calendar in which tasks, responsible parties and projected milestones are outlined.</p>
									<p><strong>COST: typically 10 – 15% of estimated construction cost </strong></p>

										<h3>Construction</h3>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="our-process-right">
									<p>Once the design is complete and you sign the construction contract, we will pull permits and begin to work on-site. We share our Google production calendar with you so you’ll know what to expect every day. We update the production calendar faithfully. During construction, our entire crew places emphasis on protecting your home and maintaining a pristine work area. One of our team leaders will serve as your point person during the construction phase. You’ll be briefed daily on our progress. We are available by phone and email 24/7 should any issues or concerns arise.</p>
									<p><strong>COST: Starting at $100,000</strong></p>

									<p>When our crew has finished construction, we turn our attention
                                        to thoroughly cleaning the project site. We remove any remaining
                                        construction debris. Then we sweep, dust and mop to remove any v
                                        estiges of our work. Finally, we send you an evaluation form so
                                        you can grade our service from start to finish. We ask for your
                                        completely candid response. Your input will shape our company as we
                                        move forward.</p>
