			  I take pride in providing a high level of personalized service, starting from the first day in your home. We aim to understand your living space and you better. We want to learn about your ideas and project vision, as well as address any specific needs. We welcome any photos or sketches you've created. Incorporating the client's personal preferences into the design allows us to create a unique and functional space. We also keep an eye on the latest trends in design and construction, offering innovative solutions.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  In our approach, we implement project management systems for transparency, efficiency, and adherence to deadlines. Demonstrating an interest in sustainable design and using environmentally friendly materials is an integral part of our philosophy. Personal involvement in the project and a willingness to work closely with clients ensure the successful realization of their dreams. Within seven days, we will provide you with a preliminary proposal, including an estimated cost breakdown.

			  After the approval of the estimate, we move on to the design and preparation phase for
			  construction. Our architect-designers will strive to align your project program with your
			  construction budget. At this stage, we explore and select materials, as well as create conceptual,
			  approval, and construction drawings. We also generate three-dimensional images to help you
			  visualize the new space. This critical stage of the project typically takes more time than
			  the actual construction and requires close coordination with your input as the client. We
			  streamline the process by creating a detailed design schedule outlining tasks, responsible
			  parties, and anticipated stages.

			  Once the project is complete, and you've signed the construction contract, we will
			  obtain permits and commence work on-site. Readiness to address unforeseen challenges
			  or make adjustments in the event of changing circumstances is a crucial aspect of our
			  approach. In case unexpected situations arise, we take measures to minimize potential delays,
			  ensuring the smooth progress of the project.
			  <br><br>
			  Specific stages will be implemented on the construction site every week or month, and we
			  will provide you with a detailed schedule so that you are always aware of our progress.
			  <br><br>
			  As a client, you have the opportunity to provide your comments or suggestions during the
			  construction process. We are open to interaction through regular meetings, online platforms,
			  or other communication tools. Your feedback is essential to us, and we strive to ensure effective
			  communication by providing regular updates and promptly addressing questions or concerns.
			  <br><br>
			  We offer 24/7 access via phone and email, even on weekends, to promptly respond to any
			  questions or changes that may arise during construction. Your construction-stage coordinator
			  will keep you informed daily about our progress and is ready to answer all your inquiries.
